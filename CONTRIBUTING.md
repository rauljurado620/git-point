# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Please feel free to put up a PR for any issue or feature request.
Even if you have little to no experience with React Native, I'll be more than happy to help. :)

## Setup

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone your fork
3. Make a branch for your feature or bug fix
4. Follow the [React Native Guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for getting started building a project with native code. A Mac is required.
5. `yarn` to install dependencies
6.`yarn run link` to link react-native dependencies
7.`yarn start` in one terminal tab to start the packager
8.`yarn run ios` in another tab to run the app in the iOS simulator
9. Work your magic! Run the app on an [actual device](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/releases/0.46/docs/running-on-device.html#running-on-device) as well to test your feature/fix.
10. Add yourself to the [contributor's list](https://github.com/housseindjirdeh/git-point#contributors) in the README!
